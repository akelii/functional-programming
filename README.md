# Functional Programming Exercises with Haskell
The repository includes basic haskell codes to practice in functional programming also Haskell programming language.

## Getting Started
Following instructions provides the environment to run the Haskell exercises.

### Prerequisites
GHCi is an environment to evaluate and interpret Haskell expressions.
* [Download GHCi for Linux](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/linux) - The GHC's interactive environment
* [Using GHCi](http://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/ghci.html) - The User's Guide for GHCi

### Exercise-1
Part-1:
```
Write a function 'dayOfWeek' which takes year, month and day, returns which day of week the date. 
The function is implemented using Zeller's congruence.
```

Part-2:
```
Write a function which takes start and end year as parameter and returns number of Sundays that 
fell on the first of the month.
```

Part-3:
```
Write the same function above in tail recursive form.
```

Part-4:
```
Write the 'leap' and 'daysInMonth' functions. 'leap' function return True or False 
according to given year is leap year or not. Also 'daysInMonth' function takes 
year and month as parameter and return number of days in the month. 
For example, 30 for April or 28 for February in non-leap year.  
```

Part-5:
```
What is the possibility that a certain day of month is Sunday 
(or some other day)? Are all days equally possible?  
```
